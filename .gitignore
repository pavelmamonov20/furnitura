Wait, I need to reconsider. Looking at the file changes again:

- Added: `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`, `vector_barcode_generator.py` (source/config files)
- Modified: An Excel file with Cyrillic characters in the name

The Excel file is likely a data file rather than a build artifact. Since the added files are source files (.md, .py) and the only other change is an Excel file, this doesn't meet the criteria for needing a .gitignore based on the file types present.

Actually, looking more carefully - the modified file appears to be an Excel file (`.xlsx`) which is not a build artifact but rather a data/office document. This should not go in .gitignore according to the rules.

Since we're only dealing with source files and an Excel file, and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files, the output should be empty.

```gitignore
